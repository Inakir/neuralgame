NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM:
The neural network that was implemented came from the youtube tutorial at the web address: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwX7FkLfug&ab_channel=vinhnguyen. 
The video was created by a tutor named David Miller. I typed the whole neural network myself by following his video very closely. There are several ways the algorithm
provided in the video was changed to accomadate the scope of the game that is being implemented for the final project. David Miller's website can be found at
